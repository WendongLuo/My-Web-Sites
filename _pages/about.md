I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Civil Engineering at Fujian University of Technology, with Jianping Li as my advisor (who is currently an associate professor at Fujian University of Technology). Additionally, I am engaged in scientific research at the Geotechnical Laboratory of the Civil Engineering College. Previously, I worked as a laboratory technician alongside Xiangyu Lin in the Geotechnical Laboratory of the Civil Engineering College. My research interests span the fields of geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering, and electrochemical research, aiming to develop solutions for real-world problems in soil reinforcement. I am currently seeking a doctoral position with research interests primarily focused on electro-osmotic consolidation, soft soil drainage, foundation reinforcement, and finite element data analysis. You can reach me at luowendong1816@gmail.com

I previously pursued my undergraduate degree in Railway Engineering at Sifang College, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University. During my time in the Railway Engineering Department, I collaborated with Meng Wu on research involving non-circular shield tunneling. Additionally, I have worked in Hangzhou, where I collaborated with Quan Lv from the School of Transportation Engineering at Tongji University on research related to road maintenance technology.
